This plugin cleans the filenames of the existing attachments filenames.

== Description ==

Backup your uploads directory and database before starting the cleaning process!

Filenames with special characters or language accent characters, like Château de Ferrières.jpg and smörgåsbord.png, can sometimes be a problem for browsers or servers. This plugin takes care of that and cleans the filenames of files already uploaded to the WordPress media library. 

This plugin is meant as a compliment to the [Clean Image Filenames](https://wordpress.org/plugins/clean-image-filenames/) plugin which cleans the filnames of new files uploaded to the WordPress media library.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `clean-existing-media-filenames` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to `Settings > Media` to start the process of cleaning existing attachments filenames.
